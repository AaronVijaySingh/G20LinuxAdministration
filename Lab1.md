1. Creating the practice files:
You can use the touch command to create multiple empty files in a single command. Replace X with the numbers 1 through 6.
touch song{1..6}.mp3 snap{1..6}.jpg film{1..6}.avi

2. Creating subdirectories:
To create the three subdirectories (friends, family, and work) in one command:
mkdir friends family work

3. Placing the files into subdirectories:
Now you can organize the files into the subdirectories. For instance, using mv to move files into appropriate directories:
mv song{1..6}.mp3 friends/
mv snap{1..6}.jpg family/
mv film{1..6}.avi work/
